We will use a Joke API, a free API that provides jokes and doesn't require an API key. For instance:

https://v2.jokeapi.dev/
https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/
etc.
Create a new HTML file and add a basic HTML structure. Add a <script> tag inside the <head> or at the end of the <body> to write your JavaScript code.

Design the layout of the joke generator with the following elements:

A "Get Joke" button to fetch a new joke.
A container to display the fetched joke.
Implement the following functionality using XMLHttpRequest or the Fetch API:

When the "Get Joke" button is clicked, fetch a random joke from the Official Joke API: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any
Parse the JSON data returned by the API and extract the joke (setup and punchline).
For the jokeapi, the data will need handling for single or two part joke types.
Display the joke in the designated container.
Add error handling to account for issues with the API request.

Style the application using CSS to make it visually appealing.

Good Luck.

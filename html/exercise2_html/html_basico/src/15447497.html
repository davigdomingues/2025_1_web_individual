<p>I am currently 18 years old, from Brasília, and transferred internally
    from the Ribeirão Preto campus, from the same course I am in now (Computer Science).
    I have always liked exact sciences as a whole, I am really into technology,
    and my goal has always been to get where I am now—at one of the best universities
    in the country, as well as a nationally and internationally recognized tech hub.</p> <!-- Paragraph tag

<h2>Activity 1: studying math</h2>

<a href="https://pir2.forumeiros.com/t52477-ita" target="_blank"><img src="imagem_forum_euclides.png"
                                                            title="section of the euclides forum page"
                                            alt="math problem present at the euclides website pir2forumeiros"></a>
<p>I like to see the complexity involved in many real life situations, where the calculus can be truly applied and
used as a tool to understand many things, like phyisical phenomenons.</p>

<h2>Activity 2: seeing solutions at WolphramAlpha</h2>

                                                            graphic of the function y = 4(x^3) + 3(2^x)"

<p>I like to see the complete analysis that many equations and functions requires the students and the researchers about
    the many kinds os contexts that these equations appears (simulations, problem-situations and so on).</p>

Instructions:

Page Structure:

Download the provided basic HTML webpage which includes a header, a few paragraphs, an image, and a list. You can also use the HTML file you developed to present yourself.
Begin by adding a general style:
Set a background color for the entire page.
Define a maximum width for the content and center it.
Typography and Color:

Modify the text:
- Set a base font size and line-height for the entire page.
- Choose a font family for headers and another for body text.
- Adjust the color and weight of the headers.
- Add hover color changes for links.

Styling Images and Lists:

For the image:
- Add a border.
- Add some shadow for a lifting effect.
- Ensure it's responsive, shrinking with the page width.

For the list:
- Add custom bullet points or numbers.
- Adjust margins and padding for proper spacing.
- Feedback and Review:

Pair up with another student and review each other's work.
Offer feedback on their design choices and any improvements that could be made.
These activities are structured to ensure that students not only practice the technicalities of CSS but also think about design decisions and get feedback. By the end, they should have a good grasp on how to effectively design and layout a webpage using CSS.
